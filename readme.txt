(Call to Order of the Court at 1:08 p.m.)
(Proceedings  took place that are not included  
in this Partial  Transcript , after which, proceedings  
continued  as follows :)
DEPUTY CLERK:  All rise.  His Honor, the Court, 
the United States District  Court for the District  of 
Alaska is again in session . 
Please be seated.  
THE COURT:  Have a seat everybody .  Sorry, my 
apologies .  So we -- what I would like to do is hear 
from the parties  as to your recommendation  as to an 
appropriate  sentence , taking into consideration  the 
factors  that are identified  in 18 United States Code, 
Section  3553(a).  
What I would like to do is give you an idea of 
what I think is probably  the appropriate  result, and 
then you can convince  me I'm right or wrong as you go 
forward , but I think it's valuable  for Counsel  to 
understand  sort of how I view the case to help inform 
your comments . 
So again, you know, the 34 -- the 3553(a) 
factors  that I think are implicated  here are:  One, the 
sentence  to reflect  the seriousness  of the offense , and 
as we heard from the testimony  today, just how serious  
the offense s in both cases were.  So I think that has

been established  in the evidence  that's been presented  
to the Court. 
I think deterrence  of criminal  conduct  is also 
important .  These are obviously  very difficult  cases to 
investigate , and it's important  that there are 
consequences  for this type of conduct .  So I think, you 
know, the deterrence  is important .  
I think protecting  the public from further  
crimes of each of the defendants  is also an important  
consideration .  I'll tell you my initial  analysis  is I 
don't think it's as important  in this case.  I think 
they are incredibly  young, and I think they have shown 
indications  that they are willing  to change their ways 
going forward .  So I think that's of a less concern  to 
me.  
And then, obviously , restitution  is going to be 
an important  factor in this case.  So taking those 
factors  into consideration , I think that something  other 
than a jail term is appropriate  in this case.  Again, I 
think these are very young defendants , they have a lot 
of opportunities  ahead of them if they can focus their 
energy in the right way, their energy and their talent.  
So I do think a probationary  sentence  is 
appropriate  for a couple of reasons .  One is I think 
when I look at those 3553(a) factors  I listed, I think

it argues for a probationary  sentence  rather than a jail 
sentence .  
The other advantage  is this:  I can be assured  
that their behavior  will conform  to societal  norms for a 
longer period if they are on probation  than if they are 
on supervised  release .  Supervised  release  is limited  to 
three years.  Probation  is five years.  
And more importantly , you know, the Government  
has probably  heard me make reference  to this, and I know 
Mr. Curtner  has heard me make reference  to this before, 
but they have the sort of Damocles  hanging  over their 
head for that five-year period.  
That means if you don't behave and you engage 
in this type of behavior  in the future, you will be back 
in front of me, and you're looking  at the same potential  
sentence  you were looking  at today.  So I think there is 
-- I think there is a great incentive  to the defendants  
to do the right thing and not violate  in the future.  
So for those reasons , I do think that a 
probationary  sentence  is more appropriate  in this case 
than a term of imprisonment .  That's my initial  read on 
the case.  
So I'll first hear from the Government , then 
I'll hear from each of the defense  counsel , if there is 
anything  anybody  wants to add, and then I'll hear from

the defendants  if there is anything  they want to say.  
MS. PELKER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I think 
what we have here really is a unique circumstance  and 
that is what's leading  the Government  to not oppose the 
probation  officer 's recommendation  of probation .  And 
that's particularly  in light of the defendants ' 
extensive  cooperation  and what's outlined  in the 
Government 's motion for a downward  departure  pursuant  to 
5K1.1.  
The Government  would emphasize  here though that 
this was incredibly  severe conduct  and that absent that 
cooperation , the Government  would be asking for a period 
of incarceration  here.  
We have defendants  who certainly  were youthful 
offenders  with no criminal  history .  They did accept 
responsibility , which were all significant  mitigating  
factors , but they don't excuse the underlying  conduct  
where we have the development  of the Mirai botnet that 
was a massive  internet  of things, botnet of the sort 
that the Government  at that point and security  
researchers  had never seen before, that took advantage  
of very novel vulnerabilities  to infect hundreds  of 
thousands  of devices , including  devices  of victims  here 
in the District  of Alaska.  
And the defendants  used those cyber skills that

we're hopeful  will help them become positive  
contributors  to society  in this case to build this 
botnet and then to launch devastating  attacks  against  
victims , both for financial  gain as well as out of 
personal  animosity .  
And then even after the defendants  learned  that 
the FBI was onto them, they went on to continue  their 
criminal  activity  in developing  and building  this 
clickfraud botnet, again, using their incredible  talents  
that they have unfortunately  been able to hone over 
years of criminal  activity .  
The Government  is very encouraged  that the 
defendants  appear to be on a very positive  path toward 
rehabilitation  here.  The Government  would like to see a 
sentence  that's crafted  to support  that sort of 
rehabilitation , but the Government  does posit that five 
years of probation  is appropriate  to allow for the 
extended  supervision  and the period of supervision  that 
the Court referenced .  
The additional  2500 hours here will address  not 
just the severity  of the defendants ' underlying  criminal  
activity  that they are being sentenced  for, but also we 
hope to reduce that chance of recidivism .  The 
2500 hours amounts  to about ten hours a week.  We would 
like that to be defined  to consist  of work by, for or

through  the FBI. 
THE COURT:  You asked for 2500 hours?  
MS. PELKER:  2500 hours of community  work 
service , which we recognize  is a sizeable amount of time 
but, given that it's extended  out across the five years, 
amounts  to about ten hours a week, and would allow the 
defendants  to continue  the type of work they have been 
doing and that we detailed  in our filings  for the FBI 
and benefiting  cyber security  researchers  to date.  
Here this will, in addition  to the supervision  
that's always already going to be provided  by the 
probation  officer , it will allow the defendants  to 
continue  their work with the FBI, who is going to be an 
added check on any potential  inclination  by the 
defendants  to return to their previous  illicit  
activities .  
We do believe  that there is an ongoing  
obligation  to protect  the public here.  Unfortunately , 
the defendants , in returning  back to the clickfraud 
botnet after developing  and building  Mirai, have shown 
that they do have an inclination  to engage in this type 
of criminal  activity .  
We definitely  have seen that since they have 
agreed to cooperate  with the Government  that they have 
engaged  in extensive  cooperation  that's been incredibly

valuable , but we want to see them on a path to continue  
down that road.  
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you very much.
Well, you look like you're next in line, 
Mr. Curtner .  
MR. CURTNER :  Well, Judge, first of all, let me 
say I think you're right, and so normally  I would spend 
more time -- 
THE COURT:  Telling  me I'm wrong?  
MR. CURTNER :  No, in advocating  for what I 
think is a proper sentence , but I think it's very clear 
the whole picture  that's been presented  to the Court 
that probation  is appropriate  for Mr. White.  
He is obviously  a young and brilliant  young man 
as far as computers  are concerned .  And I think he had a 
tremendous  lapse in judgment .  I think he recognizes  
that now.  And it's been a learning  experience  for him, 
and so I really don't think you'll ever see him again.  
And I think he's certainly  on the right path, and so I 
think probation  is the appropriate  sentence  in this 
case.  
THE COURT:  All right.  
Mr. White, is there anything  you want to say?  
You don't have to say anything , but if there is anything  
you want to say, this is your opportunity .

DEFENDANT  WHITE:  No, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  
MR. STAHL:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Obviously  
we were one of those extensive  lengthy  sentencing  
submissions  you referred  to, so I rely -- 
THE COURT:  It's in a binder actually .  
MR. STAHL:  That's how I like to go.  
Your Honor, obviously , we agree with both the 
Government  and probation  department  and the PSR for five 
years of probation .  
I would add, because  of Mr. Jha's unique 
circumstances  of school and work, and I'll explain  that 
in a moment, that I ask Your Honor to waive the home 
confinement  or a curfew provision , and it's because  of 
the following :  
As you know from our submission , Mr. Jha is in 
the School 42, and it's not the typical  university  
setting  where there is day classes  or evening  classes . 
THE COURT:  I thought  it was all online. 
MR. STAHL:  No, no, he's actually  in the Bay 
area in a dormitory .  In addition  to that they work 
their own hours in the computer  lab in the school, 
Mr. Jha is also an RA.  And he's in the dorm of 
400-some-odd students , and he is tasked at all hours of 
the day and night to go out and to go to different  areas

of the dorm when students  lock themselves  out, when they 
have other issues, computer  issues, and all sorts of 
things that go on with young people being forgetful  and 
things.  
So to have him under a curfew or electronic  
monitoring , some type of system where he would be in his 
room for particular  hours, would be impractical .  I have 
discussed  this with the Government .  I don't know if 
they still take the position  that they did in the 
sentencing  memo, but I think in his circumstances , it is 
impractical .  
And quite frankly , it's not necessary .  Mr. Jha 
has been not only working  extensively  with the 
Government  for the past year plus, he's also been out at 
the school, as Your Honor knows, for a considerable  
period of time and has had no issues at all with his 
computer  use.  It's an advanced  course.  
He's not only an RA there, but he is one of the 
trusted  members  of the school that has solved the 
computer  issues for what is an advanced  computer  school 
and has received  recognition  from the school for solving  
their network  and other problems .  
So I don't disagree  with the five years 
probation .  I don't disagree  with the hours of community  
service .  I simply would ask the Court to waive any

provision  about a curfew or some type of monitoring  
based upon his situation  right now.  
THE COURT:  Let me stop you for a second.  
What's the Government  position  on the -- 
MS. PELKER:  I believe  we would defer to the 
Court to the extent it would impact the defendant 's 
ability  to continue  with his educational  
responsibilities .  
THE COURT:  Do you feel the same way for all 
three defendants , or I mean, what if we just took an 
incremental  approach  and not impose the home 
confinement , the GPS and home confinement  at this point, 
as long as they are pursuing  their community  service , 
pursuing  educational  opportunities  or work, any 
combination  of those things.  
If there needs -- if for some reason they end 
up violating  the Court's trust and we need to tighten  
the conditions , you can always seek a modification  of 
supervision . 
MS. PELKER:  That's fine with the Government .
THE COURT:  So I think we have taken care of 
that for all three defendants .
MR. STAHL:  Thank you, Judge.  And just last, 
we don't take any issue with the restitution  number that 
has been arrived  at.

And I would just ask, based upon the 
restitution , based upon Mr. Jha as a full-time student , 
he has a part-time job now, that you would waive any 
fine. 
THE COURT:  I'm not going to impose any fine.  
MR. STAHL:  Then I will sit down.  
THE COURT:  Thank you.  
Mr. Jha, is there anything  you would like to 
say?  Again, you don't have to say anything , but if 
there is anything  you would like to say, this is your 
opportunity . 
DEFENDANT  JHA:  Yes, Your Honor.  I realize  
we're all here because  of me and the mistakes  that I 
made.  I'm fully sorry for my actions , and I apologize  
to the people and businesses  that were impacted  by them.  
I'm sorry for the family, friends  for putting  
them in trouble  with the FBI.  I'm sorry for the attacks  
against  Rutgers  and apologize  to the students  and 
faculty  that were affected .  
I didn't think of them as real people because  
everything  I did was online in a virtual  world.  Now I 
realize  I have hurt real people and businesses  and 
understand  the extent of damages  I did.  
What started  off as a small mistake  continued  
down a slippery  slope to a point where I am ashamed  to

admit what I have become.  I had not stopped  to consider  
the damage that my action was causing .  
I have hurt my parents , my family, my friends .  
I lied to them and broke their trust.  I want to say I'm 
really sorry to my mother, my father, and my family and 
friends  for putting  them through  this.  
Two years ago when I first met Special  Agent 
Elliott  Peterson , I was an arrogant  fool believing  that 
somehow  I was untouch able.  When I met him in person for 
the second time, he told me something  that I'll never 
forget:  "You're in a hole right now.  It's time you 
start digging ."  
Looking  up from my hole, I came to realize  just 
how far I had fallen.  At that point, I was at a 
crossroads in my life.  I could choose to ignore the 
consequences  of my actions, or I could face my situation  
head on and start my journey  back up.  
The first step to doing right was being open 
and honest with the transgressions .  Only then would I 
be able to start making changes  in my life.  Otherwise , 
I will always have something  to hide.  
This transparency  has allowed  me a fresh start 
in life from assisting  the FBI in several  cases to 
attending  school, to making real friends  and holding  
down a job in a field I like.

I have continued  to use these skills for the 
betterment  of society  and to start giving back some of 
what I have taken.  I cannot change the past and have to 
live with the consequences  of those actions .  I take 
responsibility  for my mistakes , and, once again, say 
sorry to all the people that were affected .  
I'd also like to thank my family, my friends  
and Agent Peterson  for helping  me through  this.  I know 
that rebuilding  trust is a monumental  task, one that I 
hope to rise up to, starting  with the changes  I have 
already  made in my life.  
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.  
MR. STAHL:  Thank you, Your Honor.  
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Okay.  
MR. NESBETT :  As with the others, Mr. Norman 
also agrees with the proposed  sentence  in this case, and 
will also, to a large extent, rest on all of the 
extensive  briefing  we all have done in this case.  
I'm sure the Court has read all of it.  And one 
of the issues that was brought  up earlier  were his 
objections  to the PSR.  It's very important  for 
Mr. Norman, throughout  all of the time that we have 
spent together  discussing  the case, it has been vitally  
important  for Mr. Norman to make sure that the Court 
understands  that his role in the Mirai virus came in at

a later date chronologically .  
It is very important  that I make sure to 
emphasize  that with the Court, that he came in in 
September , that his role was limited  to the extent that 
he didn't profit from it, and he didn't draft the code, 
nor was -- and he was actively  discouraging  the others 
from releasing  the code virus.  
He says all of that in order to put a fence 
around, in his own mind, his role in that offense , not 
in any way to subtract  from his responsibility  for what 
happened .  It's really important  that I distinguish  that 
and I help him distinguish  that.  But for his own sense 
of integrity , it is important  I pointed  that out to the 
Court.  
And the other issue I want to emphasize  from 
the briefing  was that the length of time that all three 
defendants  in this case, including  Mr. Norman, had been 
working  with the FBI on this establishes  a very 
significant  track record of credibility  and trust with 
the FBI.  That is very different  from a typical  
cooperation  type of environment  where you come in for a 
debrief , for example , and you meet once or twice with 
the agents.  
I think this sentence  helps capture  that 
history , which in turn I think emphasizes  the likelihood

that they will not be back and that recidivism  is not an 
issue that we need to worry about in this case.  
And finally , one issue that I discussed  at 
length, or at least mentioned  in my briefing  and also 
attached  some accompanying  documents  to the briefing , 
was having to do with Mr. Norman's difficulty  in speech, 
and this is related  in some ways to his conduct  in this 
case and his activity  in computers .  
But as a result of those disabilities , he has 
asked that I read a letter to you.  It's not because  
he's nervous  at public speaking  necessarily .  It's 
because  he has a disability  that prevents  him from being 
able to speak to the Court, one of the reasons  he was 
having a difficult  time even answering  yes or no 
questions  to the Court earlier .  
I would like to read that letter.  Again, this 
is something  to supplement  what he has submitted  
already .  
"Your Honor, I would again like to express  my 
remorse  for my actions .  I now have to move forward  with 
my life as a convicted  felon.  I just want everyone  in 
this courtroom  to know I'm not a malicious  monster  with 
no integrity  or morals.  I myself did not want to cause 
harm to anyone or any company  by my actions  of 
associating  with Mr. Jha and Mr. White.

"I truly regret my failures  to end this mess.  
I want to thank the FBI, especially  Agent Peterson , for 
being a positive  mentor through  this process  and by 
going above and beyond what was expected  of him.  I also 
would like to thank the Government  for suggesting  
leniency , and I promise  I will never be on their radar 
again.  
"I would like to thank the Department  of 
Justice  and the federal  court system, Your Honor, for 
appointing  Mr. Nesbett  as my attorney ."  
I didn't write that.  
"He has worked tirelessly  in my defense  and I 
will always be in debt to him.  Lastly I would like to 
thank you, Your Honor, for ruling today and being 
patient  with me through out this process .  I promise  Your 
Honor not to fail you, as I have failed myself.  I have 
to move on in my life.  
"It will be an uphill struggle  being a 
convicted  felon; however , my integrity  has never 
wavered .  I truly know right from wrong.  I just need to 
synchronize  my actions  with my thoughts  and with what my 
parents  have instilled  in me.  
"I'm very fortunate  to have a loving family who 
will support  me through  good times and bad times, as 
evident  in the last two years.  With my honor and

integrity  still ingrained  in me, I will pick up the 
pieces of this shattered  mess and make my home in New 
Orleans  proud of me one day again soon.  I will put my 
mind and my skills to a positive  effort for the 
remainder  of my life.  
"Thank you again, Your Honor, for allowing  me 
to address  the Court."  
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate  
everybody 's sentencing  comments .  You're probably  happy 
to know you haven't changed  my initial  opinion  that a 
probationary  sentence  for all three defendants  is 
appropriate  in this case.  
You know, you're still very young men.  I'm not 
sure you have any sense of -- hopefully  you're getting  
to have a sense of, and from your statements  it seemed 
like you're beginning  to have a sense of the impact what 
you did had on society , on companies , on people, on your 
families , I mean, if you think about what you put your 
families  through .  
On the other hand, you know, I got to tell you 
you're lucky because  99 percent  of the time that I 
sentence  somebody  in court here, there is nobody out 
there for them.  So I hope when you go home tonight  you 
thank your families  for being there for you, and I hope 
you never put them in this situation  you put them in

here today.  
I am also heartened  that you have developed  
such a good relationship  with Special  Agent Peterson .  
You know, in this political  climate  -- and this is not 
intended  to be a political  statement , but a lot of times 
you hear a lot of criticism  of the FBI, but I'll tell 
you you couldn't pick a better role model than Agent 
Peterson , someone  who served his country  in the Marines , 
continues  to serve his country  in the FBI.  
And I hope you take something  from that, 
because  you're young, you have a lot to give to society , 
and, you know, you have a lot of talent and skill.  I 
hope you use it for good and not bad going forward .  
So let me take these one at a time, and I'll 
start as I began, with Mr. White.  
So I'm going to impose all of the special  
conditions  that are listed, except -- with the exception  
-- and this is going to be true for all three defendants  
-- I'm not imposing  condition  number six, which is the 
monitoring  system.  But I am changing  number one, which 
is the recommendation  for 200 hours of community  service  
to 2500 hours of community  service  during this five-year 
period of probation .  
Pursuant  to the Sentencing  Reform Act of 1984 
and considering  the factors  found in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a),

which I have already  articulated , it is the judgment  of 
Court that the defendant , Josiah White, is hereby placed 
on probation  for a term of five years.  
While on probation , the defendant  shall not 
commit another  federal , state or local crime, shall not 
possess  a firearm  or illegal  controlled  substance , and 
shall comply with the collection  of a DNA sample and 
shall comply with the standard  as well as special  
conditions  included  in the judgment  issued by the Court.  
The mandatory  condition  of supervision  as set 
forth in 18 United States Code Section  3563(a)(5) 
requiring  the defendant  to submit to drug testing  is 
suspended  because  there appears  to be low risk of future 
substance  abuse by the defendant .  
The Court finds that the defendant  does not 
have the ability  to pay a fine.  It is further  ordered  
that the defendant  shall pay the United States the 
special  assessment  of $100, which shall be paid 
immediately  to the clerk of court.  
It is further  ordered  the defendant  shall pay 
restitution  in the amount of $127,000 consisting  of 
$15,000 to HyPixel , $2,000 to Psychz Network , $100,000 
to Akamai.  I'm batting  about 800 so far.  And $10,000 
to HostUS.  
The restitution  shall be joint and severally

with his co-defendants , Mr. Jha in case 
3:17-criminal -164, and Mr. Norman in case 
3:17-criminal -167.  Any unpaid amount is to be paid 
during the period of supervision  in monthly  installments  
of not less than 10 percent  of the defendant 's gross 
monthly  income or $25, whichever  amount is greater .  
Interest  on the restitution  shall not be waived.  
And there was an appeal waiver; is that 
correct ?  
MR. ALEXANDER :  Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Mr. White, as part of your 
agreement  in this case, you have given up your right to 
appeal.  Do you understand  that?  
DEFENDANT  WHITE:  Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Jha, again, same two 
changes :  I'm eliminating  special  condition  listed in 
number six and I'm modifying  condition  number one to be 
2500 hours.  
Pursuant  to the Sentencing  Reform Act of 1984 
and considering  the factors  found in 18 United States 
Code Section  3553(a), it is the judgment  of the Court 
that the defendant  is hereby placed on probation  for a 
term of five years, consisting  of five years in case 
3:17-criminal -163 and five years in case 
3:17-criminal -164 to be run concurrently .

While on probation , the defendant  shall not 
commit another  federal , state or local crime, shall not 
possess  a firearm  or illegal  controlled  substance  and 
shall comply with the collection  of a DNA sample and 
shall comply with the standard  as well as special  
conditions  included  in the judgment  issued by the Court.  
The mandatory  condition  of supervision  set

requiring  the defendant  to submit to drug testing  is 
suspended  because  it appears  to be a low -- there 
appears  to be low risk of future substance  abuse by the 
defendant .  
The Court finds the defendant  does not have an 
ability  to pay a fine.  It is further  ordered  the 
defendant  shall pay the United States the special  
assessment  of $200, which shall be paid immediately  to 
the clerk of the court.
It is further  ordered  that the defendant  shall 
pay restitution  in the amount of $127,000, consisting  of 
$15,000 to HyPixel , $2,000 to Psychz Networks, $100,000 
to Akamai and $10,000 to HostUS.  The restitution  shall 
be joint and several  with Josiah White, case 
3:17-criminal -165, and Dalton Norman, case 
3:17-criminal -167.

period of supervision  and in monthly  installments  of not 
less than 10 percent  of the defendant 's gross monthly  
income or $25, whichever amount is greater .  Interest  on 
the restitution  shall not be waived.  
Mr. Jha, same as I mentioned  in regard to 
Mr. White, you had a waiver of your appeal rights in 
this case, which means you don't have a right to appeal 
my sentence .  Do you understand  that?  
DEFENDANT  JHA:  Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  There were no charges  
to dismiss  for your client?  
MR. ALEXANDER :  That's correct . 
THE COURT:  For any of them?  
MR. ALEXANDER :  I think that's correct , Judge.  
THE COURT:  While I'm doing the last one, you 
can double-check and make sure there is no charges  that 
need to be dismissed .  
All right.  Mr. Norman, again, of the special  
conditions  I'm making the same modification .  I'm not 
requiring  that you wear any monitoring , but I am 
requiring  that you do 2500 hours of community  service  
during your five-year period of probation .  
The same -- this goes to -- same comments  to 
all three of you.  You know, part of the reason is you 
can do the community  service  in any way you like.  Like

I mentioned  before, you can work in a soup kitchen , you 
can work picking  up garbage , you can continue  to help 
provide  with your expert assistance  that can help 
others.  What's important  is you understand  that you 
have an obligation  to give back.  You have a lot of 
talent and skill, but it's not a one-way street.  
Okay.  Pursuant  to the Sentencing  Reform Act of 
1984 and considering  the found in 18 United States Code 
Section  3553(a), it is the judgment  of the Court that 
the defendant , Dalton Norman, is hereby placed on 
probation  for a term of five years, consisting  of five 
years in case 3:17-criminal -166, and five years in case 
3:17-criminal -167, to be run concurrently .  
While on probation , the defendant  shall not

have an ability  to pay a fine.  It is further  ordered  
the defendant  shall pay the United States the special  
assessment  of $200, which shall be paid immediately  to 
the clerk of court.  
It's further  ordered  that the defendant  shall 
pay restitution  in the amount of $115,000, consisting  of 
$15,000 to HyPixel  and $100,000 to Akamai.  The 
restitution  shall be joint and several  with Josiah White 
in case 3:17-crimimal -165 and Paras Jha in case

Any unpaid amount is to be paid during the 
period of supervision  in monthly  installments  of not 
less than 10 percent  of defendant 's gross monthly  income 
or $25, whichever  amount is greater .  Interest  on the 
restitution  shall not be waived.  
And I think that should take care of everything  
unless there is anything  -- I'm sorry.  I forgot to 
mention , Mr. Norman, you also in your plea agreement  
agreed to give up your right to appeal.  Do you 
understand  that?  
DEFENDANT  NORMAN:  Yes. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So there are no charges  to 
dismiss ?  
MR. ALEXANDER :  There aren't, Your Honor.  Just 
briefly , pursuant  to the plea agreement , it was

previously  discussed  during the preliminary  change of 
plea hearings , there was a term in all of the plea 
agreements  regarding  voluntary  abandonment  of 
cryptocurrency  seized during the course of the 
investigation . 
THE COURT:  Actually , I do recall that.  So 
it's not a forfeiture , it's just an abandonment .  Have 
you secured  that?  
MR. ALEXANDER :  Some of it I believe  is in FBI 
custody .  I believe  the cryptocurrency  belonging  to 
Mr. Norman, some of which I believe  was in the 
attorney 's custody , but all of which, pursuant  to the 
terms of the plea agreement , upon conclusion  of 
sentencing , should be voluntarily  abandoned  to law 
enforcement .  
THE COURT:  Mr. Nesbett  has it?  
MR. ALEXANDER :  No.  Well, Mr. Nesbett  -- I'm 
not sure if Mr. Nesbett  has it here physically .  I think 
that is actually  in FBI New Orleans  custody .  
THE COURT:  Is it just a key? 
MR. ALEXANDER :  USB thumb drive. 
MR. NESBETT :  We helped effectuate  some of that 
return at the time, but I think that went back with New 
Orleans  I believe .  
THE COURT:  So I'm a little confused .  So you

do or don't have it all?  That's kind of a yes or no.  
MR. ALEXANDER :  Your Honor, I believe  that -- 
Mr. Stahl can correct  me if I'm wrong -- that he has got 
custody  of -- 
MR. STAHL:  My understanding  is that the 
custody  has been -- it was given to FBI in Newark field 
office, so they have that.  
But whatever  we need to do, if there is 
anything , obviously , we'll effectuate  that.  
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  So I will assume 
that you'll close the loop on getting  it transferred  to 
the Government  of the cryptocurrency .  
MR. ALEXANDER :  That was all, Your Honor, just 
consistent  with the plea agreement .  I have no reason to 
believe  it won't happen. 
MR. STAHL:  I have one housekeeping  thing to 
alert Your Honor.  I have already  spoken to the court 
reporter .  Tomorrow  my office will be submitting  a 
transcript  request , including  the sealed proceedings , in 
order for Your Honor to consider .  
I believe  the Government  has no objection .  I 
would like to have the sealed proceedings  available  to 
the Court in New Jersey, Judge Shipp, and also the U.S. 
attorney 's office and probation  for Mr. Jha's sentencing  
next week, because  this cooperation  is being credited

there as well.  I think it is appropriate  to do so.  
THE COURT:  Sure.  So you'll get that request  
to me.  
MR. ALEXANDER :  My understanding  is that that 
request  is that it will remain under seal in New Jersey 
as well.  
THE COURT:  The sealed portion ?  
MR. STAHL:  It won't be made public.  It will 
be submitted  to the parties , the Court, the assistant  
U.S. attorney  and probation .  
THE COURT:  Okay.  I will sign off on that to
